##List of Effects -
(Google Chrome and Chromium may show a warning upon clicking a link, it's nothing to be concerned about but just in case, the WEBMs are included in the repo as well.)

###[Flixel (not the flash library)](https://d.maxfile.ro/eznwmhrjue.webm)
In this effect, many lines are rendered and randomly choose a direction to draw more lines while the color intensity increases, causing a nice grid-like effect.

###MouseFollowers (No WEBM video yet)
Simple effect. As you move your mouse inside the window, lines follow you.
